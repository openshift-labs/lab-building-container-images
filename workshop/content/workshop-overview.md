Containers are a lightweight form of OS-level virtualisation. They enable a set of application processes to be run in their own isolated environment, without the need to run a full operating system.

In this workshop you will learn how to build container images and run them. This will include various best practices around designing and implementing container images so as to ensure they are secure.

It is assumed you have had some previous exposure to what containers are, so we will be jumping straight into the hands on exercises.
