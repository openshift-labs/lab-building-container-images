Containers are a lightweight form of OS-level virtualisation. They enable a set of application processes to be run in their own isolated environment, without the need to run a full operating system.

In this workshop you will learn how to build container images and run them. This will include various best practices around designing and implementing container images so as to ensure they are secure.

In addition to covering general techniques, we will also look at building container images for running applications written in the Python language.

It is assumed you have a basic understanding of what containers are and using them. In case you need a refresher, we will start with a recap of running and working with containers.

We'll give links to various resources during the workshop, and a summary at the end where you can find a link to the workshop content, along with a link to a complete example that you could use as a starting point for your own container images.
